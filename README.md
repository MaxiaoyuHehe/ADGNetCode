# ADGNetCode

1. This is the implementation of our paper 'ADGNet: Attention Discrepancy Guided Deep Neural Network for Blind Image Quality Assessment' in ACM Multimedia 2022.

2. The Attention Discrepancy Calculation Method #1 is firstly released considering its potential in local quality map generation.

3. Users can run train_test_IQA.py to train a IQA model.

4. When the training procedure is done, you could try test_roi to generate local quality maps given the pre-trained weights.

5. Since the pre-trained model is more than 100M, we cannot upload it onto Github. If you want directly test the performance, please contact us (maxiaoyu@cuz.edu.cn) to obtain the pre-trained model, we can send them to you by Baidu Net Disk or Email.
